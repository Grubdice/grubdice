		<p><strong>Liar's dice</strong>, also known as Perudu, can be played with two or more players. For a game to be considered sanctioned by the L.I.A.R. (League of Incrandulous Argumentative Rollers) at least four players must be playing with a maximum of six. Seven players are allowed in the event of a majority vote. At least half of the players (rounded down for odd numbers) must be league players in order for the game to be sanctioned.</p>

		<p><strong>Each player starts with a cup and five dice</strong></p>

		<p>To see who goes first, all players roll their dice in the open. The player with the most sixes rolled goes first. In the event of a tie, ones act as a tie breaker. If no ones are rolled between tied players, or the same number of ones is rolled, those players will each re-roll to start the process again. The starting player has the choice to start the round clockwise or counter clockwise.</p>

		<p>When multiple games are played in one sitting, the previous game's winner goes first by default, and the round must transition around the table in the opposite direction of the previous game.</p>

		<div id="starting"><p><strong>Starting the game:</strong></p></div>

		<p>Each player shakes the cup and then upends it onto the table using it to conceal his/her dice from other players.</p>

		<p>Having looked at his/her dice the first player makes a call based on how many dice of a certain number there may be under all the cups. He/she has to bear in mind 2 factors:</p>

		<p><strong>1.</strong> The total quantity of dice on the table e.g if there are six players (total of thirty dice) the law of averages says that there should at least five of any number; five sixes, for example. The odds for the other numbers are more or less the same. Dependent on what you have in your hand can dictate what you 'bid'. So if you have three fives that means that you could call heavy on the fives. But then of course you can lie!</p>

		<p><strong>2.</strong> All 'ones' are wild so can be used as any number. This factor along with the open license to bluff distorts all the 'laws of averages' and opens the door further to skill, guile and a big slice of luck. This also means, that the average number of dice is about the total number of dice divided by 3. So with 30 dice, there are likely at least 10 sixes, meaning you think there are AT LEAST 10 dice that are either ones or sixes combined.</p>

		<p>Once the call is made the next player can do one of two things. He/she can either accept the bid and make and increasing bid or end the round with a call of BS or Calzone; to be explained shortly. If the bid is accepted (deemed plausible) the player must raise the call by either calling the same quantity of a higher number or a greater quantity of any number. For example, if a bid of 10 fives is made, the following bid could be 10 sixes (same quantity, higher number) or 11 of any number. <a href="#banner">(Back to Top)</a></p>

		<div id="ones"><p><strong>Ones:</strong></p></div>

		<p>Because 'ones' are wild, it means that they help every bid but no other numbers help a bid of ones. For this reason, if a player wishes to bid on ones, they may bid half the quantity of the previous bid of another number. So if 10 sixes are bid, the following player might choose to bid 5 ones. You must round up for odd numbers, so a bid of 11 of some number would require a following bid of at least 6 ones if ones are to be bid on.<p>

		<p>If the person who bids before you makes a bid on ones, such as 5 ones, and you wish to increase the bid, you may obviously bid a number higher than 5 ones. This could be 6 or more ones, or 11 of ANY other number. To bid a number other than ones, after ones have been bid, you must double the number of ones bid and add one. Looking at the example above, 5 ones are bid so you would double five to get 10 and add 1 to get 11 of whatever number you wish to bid. As noted above, this only applies if you wish to increase the bid to a number other than ones in this scenario. <a href="#banner">(Back to Top)</a></p>

		<div id="bs"><p><strong>BS:</strong></p></div>

		<p>If you disagree with the bid made before you, you can yell "BS". This immediately ends the game and all dice must be revealed. The total number of dice matching the persons bid, and all ones, are counted. If there are less then the number of dice bid, then you were right and the player who made the bid loses the difference. For example, if the bid was 10 sixes, and the total actual number of sixes AND ones combined was only 8, that player would lose 2 dice. If you are wrong and total actual number of sixes AND ones combined was 12, you would lose 2 dice. <a href="#banner">(Back to Top)</a></p>

		<div id="exact"><strong><p>Exact bids:</strong></p></div>

		<p>Often times after BS is called on a bid, the dice will all be counted to reveal that the bid was spot on and exactly correct. When this happens, the person who said BS AND everyone else lose 1 die, with the exception of the person who made the exact bid. <a href="#banner">(Back to Top)</a></p>

		<div id="calzone"><strong><p>Calzone:</strong></p></div>

		<p>Similar to BS, yelling "calzone" also ends the game. It means you think that the bid made before you is exactly right. All players reveal their dice and the total number of dice matching the persons bid, and all ones, are counted. However, the person who made the bid is safe no matter what and cannot lose dice. If you are correct, and the bid made before you is exactly right, every other player except you and the person who made the bid, lose 1 die. If you are wrong and there are more OR less actual dice then bid, you lose the difference either way. Use calzone carefully, as it can, and often will, burn the roof of your mouth. <a href="#banner">(Back to Top)</a></p>
		<p><i><strong>NOTE:</strong> Calzone may not be called when there are only two people left in the game.</i></p>

		<div id="sr"><strong><p>Show and roll:</strong></p></div>

		<p>When it's your turn to make a bid, you always have the option to show the dice you have that match the bid you're making. For example, if you bid 10 fives, you can show the other players the ones and/or fives you have under your cup by placing them in the center of the table or designated "S&R" spot. You must then re-roll the rest of your dice which may increase your odds of getting more of the number you want. These dice remain hidden, and the other dice stay in full view, and cannot be changed for the remainder of that round. You can do this on as many of your turns as you like, but it is by no means required. It simply gives the rest of the players more information, and can reduce the chances of the player next you to you calling BS on your bid. <a href="#banner">(Back to Top)</a></p>

		<div id="ludacris"><strong><p>Ludacris Speed</p></strong></div>

		<p>Ludacis is a version of the game played much, much faster. All of the rules are the exact same, with one difference. When playing "Ludacris" or "Ludacris Speed", a player only has 5 seconds to make his/her bid. The scoring for League Ludacris games is adjusted to account for the added difficulty, and is described below. <a href="#banner">(Back to Top)</a></p>

		<strong><p>When playing the game</strong> it is perfectly cromulant to lie, bluff, intimidate, insult, wildly accuse, befriend, defriend, glare at, and wink at other players. All while being, awesome, proud, mean, friendly, a sore loser, a sore winner, an ass, a jerk, a comedian, or out of your mind completely.</p>

		<strong><p>Liar's dice</strong> is a game of guesswork, bluff, luck, and no small amount of skill. You win and lose dice until such time that there is only one person remaining with any dice and he or she is the winner of that game.</p>

		<div id="scoring"><strong><p>League Scoring:</strong></p></div>
		
		<p>Earn 1 point per person you beat in a match, lose 1 per person you lose to, i.e. if you place first in a game of 5 people, you get 4 points (because you beat 4 people) i.e. if you place third of 6 people, you get 1 point (because you beat 3 people and lost to 2) Points cannot be shared, distributed, donated, or sold. </p>

		<p>In event of a tie, the people who tie average their points. Ludacris games only pay out points to the winner at half value. If a player forfeits, it is treated as an out at the time of the forfeit. So, if a player forfeits when there are in fourth place, they get the forth place points. Games that have a time limit of 18 minutes or under, are automatically Ludacris, unless a unanimous vote decides otherwise. A game over 18 minutes can also be ruled as Ludacris if a unanimous vote is passed by the current players. All votes must take place before game play begins.</p>
